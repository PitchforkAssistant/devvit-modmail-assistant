# ModmailAssistant

ModmailAssistant is a Devvit app that provides a few useful Modmail-related tools. Each of these tools come with some configuration options and can be enabled or disabled individually to your liking.

* Auto-Highlighter  
  Automatically highlight new modmail conversations from the admins or specific users.

* Auto-Archiver  
  Automatically archive modmail conversations after a certain amount of time has passed from the last reply.

* Modmail Mentions  
  This brings username mentions to modmail conversations. Have you ever wanted to ask another mod a question in modmail? Now you can get their attention by /u/-mentioning them, which will send them a private message with a link to the conversation.
